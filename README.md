# 2023 Machine Learning

This is the repository for our **Machine Learning** course's major assignment for the 2023-2024 academic year. 
Here, my source code and course report will be stored, and everything is fully open source.

We have reproduced part of the source code, conducted relevant ablation experiments on this framework, and finally evaluated its performance. We have not uploaded the training dataset required for training or the pre-trained weights required for transfer learning to the repository.
